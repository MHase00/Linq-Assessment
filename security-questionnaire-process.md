# Proposed Process for Handling Customer Security Questionnaires

## Overview
Linq regularly receives security and compliance questionnaires from enterprise customers. An efficient, streamlined process is necessary to handle these requests with minimal manual effort while ensuring accurate and consistent responses.

## 1. Intake and Triage
  - **Centralized Submission:**  
    - Create a dedicated email address or web portal for receiving questionnaires.
  - **Initial Assessment:**  
    - Assign a triage team (comprised of Security, Compliance, and Sales representatives) to review incoming questionnaires.
    - Categorize questionnaires based on complexity and urgency.
 
## 2. Standardized Response Framework
  - **Question Library:**  
    - Develop and maintain a library of pre-approved responses for common security and compliance questions.
    - Regularly update the library to reflect current policies and industry standards.
  - **Template Responses:**  
    - Create response templates for different types of questionnaires (e.g., short checklists vs. detailed forms).

## 3. Collaboration and Review
  - **Cross-Department Collaboration:**  
    - Involve subject matter experts from Security, IT, Legal, and Sales as needed.
    - Use collaborative platforms (e.g., shared documents or ticketing systems) to track changes and approvals.
  - **Internal Review Process:**  
    - Establish a review cycle where draft responses are checked for accuracy and compliance.
    - Finalize responses before sending them to customers.

## 4. Automation and Tools
   - **Automation Platforms:**  
     - Utilize customer relationship management (CRM) systems integrated with document automation tools to pre-fill and generate responses.
     - Implement tools like Vanta or Loopio.
     - Implement workflow automation tools (e.g., ticketing systems like JIRA or ServiceNow) to manage the review and approval process.
   - **Document Management:**  
     - Use version control (via GitHub or similar systems) to manage response documents, ensuring traceability and consistency.
  
## 5. Communication and Follow-up
   - **Tracking and Reporting:**  
     - Monitor the status of each questionnaire through the automated workflow.
     - Generate reports on response times and customer feedback to continuously improve the process.
   - **Feedback Loop:**  
     - Encourage customers to provide feedback on the clarity and completeness of responses.
     - Regularly review and refine the process based on this feedback.

## 6. Continuous Improvement
   - **Training:**  
     - Conduct regular training sessions for staff on the latest security and compliance requirements.
   - **Process Audits:**
      - Periodically audit the questionnaire handling process to ensure compliance with internal policies and industry standards.
      - Conduct quarterly reviews of answer database.
      - Monitor for new compliance requirements in target industries
