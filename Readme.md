Security & Compliance Take-Home Assessment Submission

Overview
This repository contains my response to Linq's Security/Compliance Associate take-home assessment, demonstrating my approach to incident response, compliance process design, and critical thinking in security practices.

1. [Phishing Incident Response Plan] (incident-response.md)
- Step-by-step containment and investigation procedures
- Notification protocol for internal teams and external parties
- Long-term technical and educational improvements
- Balanced approach focusing on both immediate remediation and prevention

2. [Customer Security Questionnaire Process] (security-questionnaire-process.md)
- Efficient workflow from intake to archival
- Clear role definitions across teams
- Automation strategies using modern GRC tools
- Metrics-driven continuous improvement framework

 3. [Security Opinion: Password Complexity] (security-opinion.md)
- Compliance is often mistaken for security, but meeting regulatory requirements doesn’t mean an organization is truly protected.
- Cyber threats evolve daily, while compliance is static, creating a dangerous gap between passing an audit and being secure.
- Many companies fall into the "checkbox mentality", focusing on meeting standards rather than actively improving security.
- Real security comes from continuous monitoring, proactive defense, and a strong security culture—not just compliance reports.


Each delivery is structured to:
1. Present the immediate solution
2. Explain the underlying rationale
3. Suggest measurable improvements
4. Reference industry standards where applicable
